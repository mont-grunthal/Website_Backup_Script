   <p>
    My name is Mont Grunthal. I am a computational science student at Florida State University.
  This program has furnished me with a knowledge of numerical analysis, statistics,
  and their applications to real world problems. As a result of my education and
  exposure to different research projects (one of which is available on this site),
  I have discovered a passion for data science which I intend to pursue with a masterâ€™s degree.
  In my free time I enjoy rock climbing and any other activity which takes me into cold climates.

    About the website.
   </h1>
   <p>
    The backend of this site was built using flask. Flask is an open source
  python library that is both free and easy to learn. Https support was provided
  by certbot, which is also free, transparent and easy to use. The website is served
  by a linux server hosted by linode. Additional content both personal and academic
  will be added in the future. Hopefully I can also learn some graphic design
  skills to improve the look of this site. However, I am not holding out hope that
  I'll gain artistic vision at this point in my life. Instead, please enjoy a
  picture of my cat.
   </p>

   <p>
    If you are here looking for a real estate broker,
  you're probably looking for Mont Grunthal Sr.
  Who, despite having the abilty for decades,
  has neglected to buy the domain montgrunthal before
  his son, Mont Grunthal. I"m only including this section because
  if find that fact so deeply funny that I feel a bit guilty.
  He can be conacted at montgrunthal@gmail.com.
